TwixT-tactics

Introduction and motivation (you can safely skip this)

In the mid 70s my parents were just married and the oil crisis struck, creating the "autoloze zondagen" (car-less Sundays; to reduce gas consumption). At that time, 3M published 2 games, which my parents bought: Twixt and Acquire. At about 10 years of age (mid 80s), my father taught me TwixT: explaining the basic rules, beating me in the game and explaining his tactics. We didn't play it that much (as far as I remember), but I have some very good memories of rainy winter Sunday's playing with my dad. 

In the next 30 years, I occasionally played Twixt against a newcomer to the game, which always was in my opinion always an easy win. Now that my own son is 9 years old, I picked up the game, discovered [the TwixT puzzles online](http://www.ibiblio.org/twixtpuzzles/), played several games on [TwixT Live](https://twixtlive.com) and on [Little Golem](https://www.littlegolem.net). I contributed to [Twixtbot-ui](https://github.com/stevens68/twixtbot-ui), a graphical user interface on top of [twixtbot](https://github.com/BonyJordan/twixtbot). Based on the games played, I discovered tractical patterns that emerged in  In the following section, I share those patterns with you, in the hope that they contribute to your interest and enjoymen for the game of TwixT.
